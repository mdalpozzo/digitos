Please create a javascript script that will accomplish the below:

1. Generate 6 integers, all 2 digits or less.

2. Use the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to 
combine any two integers from the current set to produce a new integer.

3. The operation must yield a new integer. That means, if you use division, the result must be 
an integer (i.e., no decimal results are allowed).

4. After an operation, replace the two used integers with the resulting integer. 
(The first set will be 6 integers, the second set will be 5, the third will be 4, etc...)

5. Try to reach a target integer in as few operations as possible.

6. Return a target integer that can be arrived at using the generated integers.
